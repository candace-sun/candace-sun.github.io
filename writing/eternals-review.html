  <h1><b>Subversive Feminism in Marvel</b></h1>
  <i>The Power of an Earthly Feminine: Reviewing Eternals (2021)</i><br>
  Oct 2025
  <br /><span class="mono">---</span><br><br>
  Eternals (2021) is a Marvel Studios film directed by Chloé Zhao, who wrote the
  screenplay alongside Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo, and Kaz Firpo. It features a large ensemble
  cast of stars including Gemma Chan, Richard Madden, Kumail Nanjiani, Lia McHugh, Brian
  Tyree Henry, Lauren Ridloff, Barry Keoghan, Don Lee, Kit Harington, Salma Hayek, and
  Angelina Jolie. It is adapted from the race of the same name featured in Marvel Comics, and has
  a longer run time that reaches two and a half hours. The story follows a team of Eternals, who
  are immortal beings that are tasked by a higher power, the Celestials, to protect Earth and
  humanity from monsters known as Deviants. Faced with unexpected tragedy, they are forced to
  come out of hiding and rejoin forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  The way that the film takes a step back from the archetypical superhero movie
  particularly drew my interest; we follow a complicated and large ensemble of equally powerful
  characters led by a soft-spoken female hero named Sersi, while examining the complexities of
  moral values, purpose and relationships. The film received largely mixed reviews from the
  typical Marvel audience, lamented as slow and convoluted, but for me Eternals is elegantly
  subversive; it is ultimately more human than supernatural, and the story is told with emotion and
  complemented by action — a rare twist with a feminine nature.
  <br>
  <br>
  Though we are reminded that the Eternals are completely nonhuman, it is easy to forget
  as we watch them interact with civilization, their human partners, and themselves; from this,

  Zhao humanizes their motivations and struggles. As a director, she specializes in capturing
  human connection with the camera, and watching the special bonds between pairs of characters
  brings them all to life. Eternals was released during a back-to-theaters push, past the height of
  the COVID-19 pandemic and within a climate of activism from Black Lives Matter discourse; it
  then took the opportunity to bring authentic diversity to a Marvel film. On paper, the Eternals
  roster seems to check a suspicious number of boxes — Phastos, a Black engineer and the first
  openly gay hero, Makkari, a deaf sprinter, Kingo, a muscular Bollywood star, and the leader
  Sersi, an educated Asian woman. However, by setting the focus on their personalities, flaws, and
  chemistry instead of their identifying characteristics, Zhao makes their differences feel
  beautifully complementary rather than forced.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhao additionally makes several modifications to the source material in the film. Firstly,
  the Deviants are largely simplified from sentient, complex beings themselves to primal
  antagonists. Additionally, Sersi’s troubled love interest, Ikaris, is changed to be detached from
  humans, contrasting from a more caring nature in the comics. These edits serve to further
  accentuate the Eternals team and draw out the fractures in their dynamics, particularly to help
  Sersi shine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diving into the cinematic world of Eternals, rather than exploring multiverses and
  magical planets, we are grounded in an extremely earthly atmosphere, from Alaskan snow to a
  Pacific volcano. The costumes of the Eternals are similarly elemental, with geometric patterns
  and subdued shades of green, blue and red. The environment becomes the mood, and a narrator
  in our story; it makes sense, as we are watching a story of Earth and human society itself, from
  Mesopotamia to London. For instance, the setting sun is a recurring symbol of love, connection
  and new beginnings, especially as displayed by Sersi. Her first gift to a human child is backlit by

  a golden glow; we see it again when she first kisses Ikaris, and when she first communicates with
  the Celestial Arishem. The sun’s warmth in these scenes provides stark contrast to the dark and
  stormy exposure we see in more tumultuous sequences during the movie, such as the evening
  battle with the Deviants in the shadows of the Amazon; these visual cues are raw and
  sentimental, complementing the overarching theme of the clash between light and darkness
  within the Eternals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Expanding on the idea of eternal turmoil, the characters themselves are delicately
  balanced in unexpected ways, which brings underrepresented dynamics to light. First, Sersi
  represents a feminine compassion and love for life. Ikaris, on the other hand, serves as her foil:
  masculine, purpose-driven, and largely unforgiving. What’s unconventional is how Sersi is
  ultimately given the power to lead. In this genre, we are used to that privilege falling neatly into
  the hands of a vengeful man, but Sersi sets herself apart with her strong will to protect; she
  doubts her competence, but the other Eternals don’t. Her morals of the ends not justifying the
  means resemble those of other heroes, yet they do not become her weakness, as seen in common
  tropes of women sacrificing themselves for their cause (Black Widow in Avengers: Endgame) or
  sparing their tormentor on moral high ground (Katara in Avatar: The Last Airbender). Instead,
  Zhao offers the subversion of it being Ikaris who suffers the fatal weakness — of loving her.
  Sersi can be seen as representing the feminine Mother Earth, whether from her green suit, her
  power to transform physical matter, or in her tender, nuanced relationships with her human
  boyfriend and the other Eternals. Her devotion is poignantly illustrated by the Eternal Thena,
  goddess of war, when she consoles Sersi in her decision to defend humanity: “When you love
  something, you protect it. It’s the most natural thing in the world” (1:52:19).

  <br>
  <br>
  Eternals is not perfect; it takes on an imposing number of themes, and there are
  occasional moments that feel shallow because they are told, rather than felt. However, its
  distinctly ethereal, naturalistic style and unconventional storylines marks the film as one to
  remember. Its heroine puts gentle nature at the helm of victory, and it challenges the superhero
  formula, distinct from the “strong, independent woman” rehash that is too reminiscent of male
  narratives in different “girl power” packaging. The Eternals are a breath of fresh air; they are
  maternal and feminine in their care for humanity, and they derive power from their duty of
  protection and nurture, not from conquering and destruction. All of this doesn’t take away from
  the breathtaking action sequences, which only add to the grandeur of earthly power that Zhao
  expertly crafts. Eternals is chaotic, serene, beautifully touching and entirely unpredictable — just
  like its muse, planet Earth.
